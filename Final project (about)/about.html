<h2>
I am all about music and literature. Without these things I feel like I would be nothing because they are what keep me going.
I need to listen to at least two songs in the morning and then on car rides the radio has to be on, then on my free time after school my headphones are always in playing some of my favorite songs.
People usually stick to one specific genre of music but I like to mix it up a bit, I listen to pop, rock, punk, 80's music, dubstep violin, R&B and many more that don't seem to go well together but that just says a lot about the person I am.
Literature wise I love to read science fiction, discovering new worlds amazes me. Getting to be different people every single time I flip a page is just awesome and I love it.
I feel that I am the person you go to when you need new music or some book suggestions and that is totally ok.
