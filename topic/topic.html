<h2> 
A producer has many roles during the recording process. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.
A producer may also select session musicians to play rhythm section accompaniment parts or solos; propose changes to the song arrangements; coach the singers and musicians in the studio to encourage them to do their best; the producer helps the band to polish their performances and get the desired sound and tone that a specific genre or style of music requires. The producer controls or provides guidance during the recording sessions, such as by selecting the audio engineer and, in some cases, controlling the audio console to adjust the mix and sound of the recording. In some cases, the producer may not do the mixing, but they will nevertheless help select the engineer, and provide suggestions to the engineer. The producer typically supervises the entire process from preproduction, through to the sound recording and mixing stages, and, in some cases, all the way to the audio mastering stage.
